2. Place `NG_Client` in **StarterPlayerScripts**.  
3. Place `NG_Config` in **ReplicatedStorage**.  
4. Configure `NG_Config` for your game. (Default settings work for most games.)

## Important Note
If you leave **CheckForLocalScript** enabled, make sure you **do not have any files named `"LocalScript"`** in PlayerScripts or Backpack, otherwise the anti-cheat will trigger false positives. ( this feature will be improved! )
